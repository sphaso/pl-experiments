# Programming Language Experiments
Experiments from the book "Essentials of Programming Languages" by Friedman and Wand    

LET - parser missing    
PROC - parser missing    
LETREC - skipped, since PROC already includes recursion    
(DeBruijn) - Added indices to PROC, finally hacked a currying-working implementation but something else is broken. :(
